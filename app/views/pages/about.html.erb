    <p>CAS began in January 2021, so we are a brand new society!

  We strongly believe in the power of art to inspire and educate, and to facilitate important conversations surrounding social, political, and environmental issues!

  We run bi-monthly events that focus on specific issues or artists - they are informative and FUN, and now that lockdowns have buggered off, they will be followed by socials such as games and club nights!

  Our past events have all been on zoom, and while we’re SUPER excited to begin hosting in person events, we will be live streaming events for any students that cannot attend or are still operating virtually!

  We will also upload recordings of each event so that you can watch them back at your leisure
